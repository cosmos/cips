Cosmos Improvement Proposals (CIPs) describe standards for the Cosmos platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and module and IBC standards.

**Before you initiate a pull request**, please read the [CIP-1](https://cips.cosmos.network/CIPS/cip-1) process document. Ideas should be thoroughly discussed prior to opening a pull request,
such as on the [Cosmos forums](https://forum.cosmos.network) , or in a [GitHub issue in this repository](https://github.com/cosmos/cips/issues). CIPs should begin by copying the
[cip-template](./cip-template.md).

<!-- 
TODO
This repository tracks the ongoing status of CIPs. It contains:

- [Draft](https://cips.cosmos.network/all#draft) proposals which intend to complete the CIP review process.
- [Last Call](https://cips.cosmos.network/all#last-call) for proposals that may become final (see also [RSS feed](https://cips.cosmos.network/last-call.xml)).
- [Accepted](https://cips.cosmos.network/all#accepted) proposals which are awaiting implementation or deployment by Cosmos client developers.
- [Final](https://cips.cosmos.network/all#final) and [Active](https://cips.cosmos.network/all#active) proposals that are recorded.
- The [CIP process](./CIPS/cip-1.md#cip-workflow) that governs the CIP repository. -->

Achieving "Final" status in this repository only represents that a proposal has been reviewed for technical accuracy. It does not imply approval for the proposal to be accepted by Cosmos.
For that, turn to [Cosmos Governance](https://github.com/cosmos/governance). It is solely the responsibility of the reader to decide whether a proposal will be useful to them.

Browse all current and draft CIPs on [the official CIP site](https://cips.cosmos.network/).

(TODO: setup this bot): Once your first PR is merged, we have a bot that helps out by automatically merging PRs to draft CIPs. For this to work, it has to be able to tell that you own the draft being edited. Make sure that the 'author' line of your CIP contains either your GitHub username or your email address inside <triangular brackets>. If you use your email address, that address must be the one publicly shown on [your GitHub profile](https://github.com/settings/profile).

## Project Goal

The Cosmos Improvement Proposals repository exists as a place to share concrete proposals with potential users of the proposal and the Cosmos community at large.
