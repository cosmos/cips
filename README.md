Cosmos Improvement Proposals (CIPs) describe standards for the Cosmos platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and module and IBC standards.

**Before you initiate a pull request**, please read the [CIP Process](./cips/process.md) document. Ideas should be thoroughly discussed prior to opening a pull request,
such as on the [Cosmos Discussion Boards](https://github.com/orgs/cosmos/discussions/categories/cip) , or in a [GitHub issue in this repository](https://github.com/cosmos/cips/issues). CIPs should begin by copying the
[cip-template](./cip-template.md).

Browse all current and draft CIPs on the official CIP site (Coming Soon..)

(TODO: setup this bot): Once your first PR is merged, we have a bot that helps out by automatically merging PRs to draft CIPs. For this to work, it has to be able to tell that you own the draft being edited. Make sure that the 'author' line of your CIP contains either your GitHub username or your email address inside <triangular brackets>. If you use your email address, that address must be the one publicly shown on [your GitHub profile](https://github.com/settings/profile).

## Project Goal

The Cosmos Improvement Proposals repository exists as a place to share concrete proposals with potential users of the proposal and the Cosmos community at large.
