This document is used as a template for Module Readiness Checklists.

It is intended to serve mainnet decision makers with relevant information for deciding when a module is ready for deployment onto a mainnet, e.g., Cosmos Hub.

The checklist is intended to be easy to complete by the Module Readiness Committee.

Not all items on the checklist need to have items.
